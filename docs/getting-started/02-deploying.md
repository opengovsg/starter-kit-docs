# Deploying your application

Starter Kit uses [Vercel](https://vercel.com) as our deployment platform. Vercel provides hosting for web applications, and offers a range of tools to aid with maintaining your product, including integrations with GitHub.

Setting up Vercel for your product can be done via the deploy button below.

## Step 1: Creating your repository

Vercel will prompt you for a name to create a new GitHub repository. This will create a copy of the Starter Kit code base in your chosen location.

Once you have chosen a name, click Create.

## Step 2: Configuring your project

Once your repository has been created, you will need to provide the required set of environment variables.
